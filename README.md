# Documentation

Django Project based on [Cryce Truly's project](https://github.com/CryceTruly/TrulyInexpensible/tree/master).

### Proposal: A web application to manage finances in different currencies, henceforth the name, ManageFinances.

### Resources: Expenses CRUD, Authentication, User Preferences management.

So far, following the project and adding some QoL learned from my previous experiences and newer versions of Django.

### Future Objectives

Add side branches to implement radical changes.
  * 1 - Fully update the model and forms structure to newer standards, including Django forms and crispy forms usage.
  * 2 - Revamp the database structure to add a multi-tenancy layout (same db, users split by 'tenant_id').
  * 2.1 - Soft tryout on the (same db, different schemas).
